This is a new experimental blog for short notes on topics I'm thinking or learning about. I already have a [blog](/) where I've been writing somewhat regularly for around two years now. But it already has a pretty defined format—long-form articles about programming—and I'm reluctant to add posts that deviate a lot from that.

I've tried this once before [on Substack](https://chidi.ws), but I ended up not liking the send-everyone-an-email-every-time-I-write-something format: what I really want is a place to document things and "think out loud".

There's also Twitter, but I've been using that a bit less often recently (or at least trying to)—which may be related to not having a lot of overlap between my "audience" on Twitter and the topics I'm interested in outside tech. And in any case, I find the blogging format much more friendly for writing than Twitter threads.

I don't expect to share everything I write here on Twitter, except I think it's particularly interesting. But you can grab the [RSS feed](/blog/index.xml) (you know...if you're still into that sort of thing).

Hopefully, this helps me get a lot more comfortable writing and maybe even ends up being fun.
