**Hi, I'm Chidi.** I'm a software engineer, currently working in the finance industry in London. Before my current role, I built consumer and business fintech products at a startup in Lagos.

I write articles about what I'm learning and building on this blogâ€”most of them about programming and technology. Outside tech, I also like to [read](/bookshelf/) and [play music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusE4ZHQoVPJ-zzhZZSyL9w).

You can find me on Twitter at [@chidiwilliams\_\_](https://twitter.com/ChidiWilliams__) or send me an email at williamschidi1@gmail.com.
