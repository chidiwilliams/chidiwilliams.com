I recently watched [The Humane Representation of Thought](https://vimeo.com/115154289), a conference talk by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/), where he discusses why and how we should design new representations of ideas that fit better with our human capabilities.

Bret highlights how, throughout history, intellectual progress has been connected to the development of new ways of representing and communicating knowledge. The Hindu-Arabic numerals and place-value notation expanded the space of possibilities in the world of mathematics. Better representations of the atom—from Dalton’s to Rutherford’s to Bohr’s—facilitated the advancement of physics and engineering. And the development of print and electronic media shaped how we learn, work, and share ideas. These forms of media changed not just what we thought and how we thought, but what was _thinkable_.

When we carefully consider the development of these media, however, we see that they have led to an unbalanced way of living. Due to the widespread use of print and electronic media, what we call knowledge work today typically involves “sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols on tiny rectangles”. We have rich, natural ways of interacting with and experiencing the world, but we have developed a culture constrained by the paper and screen. To Bret, this mode of creating is inhumane: wasteful of the vast human potential.

Take music as an example. The most common way to interact with music is by _listening_ to it. But the experience of music isn’t limited to the auditory alone. Through sheet music, it’s possible to also _read_ music. If you’ve ever been in a loud concert, you know it’s also possible to _feel_ the vibrations of sound waves. And if you play a musical instrument, you can feel music in a different way—you learn what a B chord feels like, for example, from the shape your fingers make when you play it.

These modes of interaction produce different kinds of experiences and each one is meaningful in its own way. We wouldn’t choose to limit our expression of music to any single form, like by only reading symbols on a sheet of paper. But that’s not very different from how we program today. By far, the most common way of writing, reading, and interacting with software is by manipulating symbols.

What would a more humane representation of ideas look like? We could use pictures and videos to communicate how programs work, but while these formats improve on text in some ways, they are still largely rudimentary and static. Instead, Bret proposes three different dynamic representations of media for teaching and learning.

First, we can move abstract concepts into physical space with **dynamic spatial media**. A good example of this would be creating a physical representation of a book as a room or a museum. A “reader” of this book would interact with the book’s concepts by moving around the room, exploring, and manipulating physical objects. In the case of software, this might mean using physical, instead of abstract, objects to write programs, taking computation out of the machine and into the physical world.

We can also create **context-sensitive learning models**. Think about what learning material looks like today. A book or blog post typically expects the reader to have some background knowledge relevant to the material. But a more humane version would be sensitive to each reader’s unique backgrounds and interests. It would be aware of what each reader knows and adapt to their needs.

Bret also proposes what he calls **“explore-the-model” reading material**. In this media, the author isn’t just lecturing the reader, but guiding them through exploring dynamic models. Compared with static, unresponsive formats like text and pictures, the reader will be able to interact directly with the learning content itself.

It was here that the lightbulbs lit up for me. I've casually attempted “explore-the-model” reading materials here on this blog, but this was the first time I was hearing it articulated as a well-formed idea. A few blog posts I’ve written like [Text Search with Tries](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/text-search-with-tries/) and [Quadtrees in the Wild](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/quadtrees/) have inlined programs where the reader can explore the material being taught.

By clicking and dragging on controls and watching the visualizations in these programs, the reader augments syntax with the visual and the tactile and gains a richer understanding of the subject.

Bret Victor’s talk invites us to rediscover the richness of our human capabilities. How do we build tools that make better use of our means of understanding and experience? How do we communicate ideas in more humane forms? How do we create and communicate programs in the dynamic medium? What new possibilities will this open up?
