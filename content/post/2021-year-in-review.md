description: Reflecting on what I worked on and learnt in 2021

_Previously: [2020](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/2020/)_

I wrote my [first-ever annual review](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/2020/) at the end of 2020, reflecting on what I worked on and learnt during the year. Here's what I was up to in 2021:

## Work and life

At the end of 2020, I left Lagos, where I had lived all my life, and moved to work and live full-time in London. It was somewhat challengingâ€”due, in no small part, to the still-ongoing pandemic. But overall, I've enjoyed living in the new city so far: making new friends and trying out new experiences.

I also had a good year at work. I worked remotely for most of the year, and I got to work on a few projects I found exciting and challenging. I also got promoted to associate (like mid-level) at the end of the year.

## Blog

![Blog stats for 2020 and 2021](https://res.cloudinary.com/cwilliams/image/upload/v1640998883/Blog/E60DC86A-40A5-4247-855F-330311136BC9.png)

This past year, I wrote sixteen blog posts (including three newsletter issues), twice as much as the eight posts I wrote in 2020. (I started this blog in May 2020.) In total, I wrote about 25k words, which is also about twice as much as the 12k words I wrote in 2020.

I don't have writing volume/frequency goals, so I can't quite say the number of posts was good or bad. But throughout the year, I tried to keep a steady pace: publishing when I learn something I think someone else might find interesting. So far, it's been great to hear good feedback from a few people for whom the posts have been helpful.

Here's a quick recap of the posts from 2021:

- Building an expression evaluator ([Part 1](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/evaluator/)\*, [Part 2](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/evaluator-2/)): A guide on building expression evaluators. The first post covered the three stages of evaluating simple expressions: tokenization, RPN conversion, and RPN evaluation. The second extended the evaluator with functions, relational operators, and variables.
- [GOTO Reconsidered](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/goto/): Reminiscing on my early days of programming with BASIC, I wrote about the history of the GOTO statement and its relationship with other constructs, like conditional blocks, loops, breaks and continues.
- [Gifts and Games](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/gifts-and-games/): On my experience trying out the Oculus Quest 2.
- [The Proof-of-Work Spam Filter](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/proof-of-work/)\*: Some notes from learning about the history and implementation of Hashcash, an early proof-of-work system.
- [Why Chrome Runs So Many Processes](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/chrome-processes/): Trying to figure out why Chrome was using up so much of my computer's resources, I spent some time learning about the architecture of Google Chrome and other browsers.
- [The Tradeoffs We Make](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/tradeoffs/)\*: What are some typical tradeoffs we make when building software? How do we get better at making tradeoffs?
- [Quadtrees in the Wild](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/quadtrees/)\*: First part of a series on data structures and algorithms and the problems they solve. In this one, I talk about the quadtree and its application in location indexing and image compression.
- [The Game Called Life](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/game-of-life/): I can't remember when I first heard of the Game of Life, but I've been fascinated by it for some time. This post discusses how the game works.
- [Redraw Only The Diff](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/redraw-only-the-diff/): A reflection on the diffing pattern I sometimes use for the animations in my blog posts.
- [Introductions, Math Games, and UI Optimizations](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/introductions-math-games-and-ui-optimizations/): The first issue of the newsletter; a digest of the previous two blog posts.
- [Text Search with Tries](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/text-search-with-tries/)\*: Second part of the series on data structures and algorithms focused on the trie and its applications in text search.
- [Fooled by Complexity](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/fooled-by-complexity/): For the second newsletter issue, I wrote about how complex software feels like effective software even when it isn't.
- [25 Days of Advent](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/25-days-of-advent/): On my experience participating in Advent of Code.
- [The Humane Representation of Programs](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/the-humane-representation-of-programs/): After listening to a talk by Bret Victor, I got inspired to think about better ways to teach programming.
- [A Refresher on Software Vulnerabilities](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/a-refresher-on-software-vulnerabilities/): A review of some common vulnerabilities from the 2021 CWE Top 25 list.

(The posts marked with asterisks were the five most popular.)

I also tried out a few experiments with the blog's format within the year. The tech stack (Hugo static site running on Netlify) is still the same, but I made minor design changes. I also started sending out [a newsletter focused on the blog](https://buttondown.email/chidiwilliams). I've sent out five emails so far, and the newsletter currently has about 80 subscribers. I like the medium as a way to directly reach readers who want to keep up with the blog.

I (casually) also started a [Substack newsletter](https://chidi.ws/) a few months ago. I'd initially wanted it as a place to write about topics unrelated to programming. But after publishing one article, a [book review](https://chidi.ws/p/recent-reads-the-outsider-and-before), I don't think I'll be writing there anymore. Managing two different newsletters feels like more work than necessary at the moment. Plus, I still prefer hosting and controlling my own work for myself.

## Projects

I didn't get to work on as many new hobby projects as I would have liked this past year. But I enjoyed building the interactive programs I use to illustrate blog posts, like [chidiwilliams/conway-game-of-life](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/conway-game-of-life) (for the post on Conway's Game of Life) and [chidiwilliams/dsaw](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/dsaw) (for the data structures and algorithms series). I also open-sourced all my [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/advent-of-code).

## Reading

I try to keep a regular reading habit and read across different genres based on my interests and curiosity. This year, in particular, I got to read a lot more fiction. I've found fiction a bit more challenging to work through than non-fiction after childhood. But this past year, I found a few books in the genre that were fun and rewarding to read.

Some of my favourite reads of the year were:

- _The Outsider_ - Albert Camus
- _The Great Gatsby_ - F. Scott Fitzgerald
- _Skin in the Game_, _Fooled by Randomness_, _The Bed of Procrustes_ - Nassim Nicholas Taleb

And a few books from my [anti-library](https://fs.blog/the-antilibrary/) this year (books I added to my shelf but haven't yet read or completed):

- _Economic Facts and Fallacies_, _Intellectuals and Society_ - Thomas Sowell
- _A Room of One's Own_ - Virginia Woolf
- _Finite and Infinite Games_ - James Carse
- _The Trial_, _The Castle_, _Metamorphosis_ - Franz Kafka

## Goals for 2022

Next year, I'd like to:

- **Do more learning experiments.** Try new technology and become a better software engineer. I recently got Robert Nystrom's _Crafting Interpreters_, and I'm looking forward to reading it and writing a programming language and interpreter soon. I also plan to spend more time learning about peer-to-peer/decentralized technology.
- **Write more posts.** I've enjoyed writing on this blog this past year. Among other things, it's helped me share what I'm learning and find other people with similar interests to mine. And I plan to continue into the new year. I also plan to write a comprehensive tutorial on the HTML Canvas, specifically on how I use it to make the interactive programs on this blog.

(Plus a few other professional goals at work and personal goals that don't fit nicely into a public list.)

I'm grateful for all I got to do this past year. And I'm excited to explore more of what I can learn, build, and share in the new year!

_I hope you had a good year as well. I'd love to hear about your reflections and goals. Have a wonderful new year!_
