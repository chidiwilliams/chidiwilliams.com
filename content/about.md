Hi, my name is Chidi. I'm a software engineer, currently working at an investment bank in London. Before my current role, I built consumer and business fintech products at [a startup in Lagos](/2020/#changing-jobs). I've also written a few [open-source projects](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/), including some [Web-based simulations](/simulations/).

I love playing the piano and guitar and reading about computing, science, and philosophy. You can find a list of books I'm currently reading or curious about on [my bookshelf](/bookshelf/).

I write articles about what I'm learning or building on this blog. Most of them will be about programming and technology.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChidiWilliams__). When I'm not building something or playing music, I'm usually hanging out there.
