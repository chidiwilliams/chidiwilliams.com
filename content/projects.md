Here's a list of some projects I've made. Many of the projects are supplements to blog posts I wrote, while others were for learning, personal use, or fun.

### [Lox playground](https://chidiwilliams.github.io/lox-playground/)

A web-based REPL and web editor for running Lox programs. The playground runs [Loxjs](#loxjs), a JavaScript implementation of the tree-walking interpreter from Bob Nystrom's [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

### [Glox](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/glox)

A Go implementation of the Lox interpreter.

### [Wordle AI](https://chidiwilliams.github.io/wordle/)

A clone of Wordle that features an AI player. See: [_A Wordle Solver_](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/a-wordle-solver/).

### [Expression Evaluator](https://chidiwilliams.github.io/expression-evaluator/)

A math expression evaluator made with JavaScript. See: [_Building an Expression Evaluator_](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/evaluator/).

### [Github Stories](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/github-stories)

A Chrome extension for viewing stories on your GitHub dashboard (for the laughs).

_...web-based animations like [3D orbits](https://chidiwilliams.github.io/3d-orbit-simulation/), [drum machines](https://chidiwilliams.github.io/3d-drum-machine), and [fractals](https://chidiwilliams.github.io/sierpinski-hexagon/)â€”and more on [GitHub](https://github.com/chidiwilliams)!_
