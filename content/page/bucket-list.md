Here's a list of some of the things I would love to see, learn, and do.

I'll update the list as I complete the items or add new tasks. I suspect I won't be able to complete them all. Some may need time, opportunity, or financial or physical abilities I don't have. But completing even half of the list would be exciting. And maybe even rewarding.

_8/6/2021_: 0/17 completed

1\. **See the northern lights**

_8/6/2021_: Auroras (or polar lights) are light displays caused by solar winds interacting with the Earth magnetic field. The lights in Norway look [breathtaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izYiDDt6d8s). (I think I first learned about them from the [spirit lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGSiHpuTzQU) in _Avatar: The Legend of Korra_.)

2\. **Run a 10k**

_8/6/2021_: The farthest I've gone in a single run is currently 5.24 km (22/5/2021).

3\. **Learn to speak a second foreign language**

(...English being the first...obviously, I hope.)

4\. **Learn to play another musical instrument**

_8/6/2021_: At the moment, I think this might be the ukulele. It's not very different from the guitar, [which I play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rujiFturYw). So it shouldn't be too difficult to pick up. More importantly, it moves me a step closer to becoming Tyler Joseph from the Twenty One Pilots.

5\. **Go skydiving**

6\. **Deadlift my body weight**

_8/6/2021_: I haven't even tried deadlifting before. Ever. This should be..._fun_.

7\. **Read a book written in Igbo**

_8/6/2021_: My spoken Igbo isn't great, but my reading is even worse. I'd love to learn to read and understand a complete book in Igbo.

8\. **Visit Japan**

_8/6/2021_: I've heard beautiful things about the country.

9\. **Go on a meditative retreat**

_8/6/2021_: Stay somewhere quiet, with little-to-no technology, practising mindfulness for a few days.

10\. **See the Large Hadron Collider**

_8/6/2021_: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a [27-kilometre-long ring of magnets in Geneva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=328pw5Taeg0). Physicists use the LHC to smash subatomic particles together to find new particles. It's a remarkable feat of engineering. And I've had it on my to-visit list [for some time now](https://twitter.com/ChidiWilliams__/status/1294975851340201985).

11\. **Learn to swim**

_8/6/2021_: I can't think of any valid reason why I don't know how to swim. None at all.

12\. **Learn a dance**

_8/6/2021_: Literally any complete dance. This could have been easy if I wasn't so terrible at dancing.

13\. **Go stargazing**

_8/6/2021_: Starry night, up on a hill, telescope in hand. That kind of thing.

14\. **Float in zero-gravity**

_8/6/2021_: This is a tough one, considering zero-gravity flights currently cost [around $7,000](https://www.airzerog.com/reservation/). But I can't think of many things seven-year-old me would find cooler than floating in zero-G.

15\. **Go scuba diving**

16\. **Start a startup**

_8/6/2021_: Technically, I have "kind of" helped start startups in the past. And I've helped start things that were "kind of" startups. But I'd like to cofound a technology company for real sometime in the future.

17\. **Watch Ludovico Einaudi perform live**

_8/6/2021_: Ludovico Einaudi is an Italian classical pianist and one of my favourite musicians. I find [his songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPlkHxFA-Qg&list=PLisS59efNHJlJDa3sibFcwUvJ1vdeKmFe&index=11) beautiful and soothing.
