After reading an essay or listening to a talk I really like, I often immediately try to find the author’s (or speaker’s) earlier work. At first, it started because I was about the other things the author has made, but it’s now a habit I practice whenever I see work I admire.

I've found that I often underestimate how long people spend creating the kind of work I admire. For example, three of my favourite software engineering blogs are [Julia Evans'](https://jvns.ca/), [Joel Spolsky's](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), and [Hillel Wayne's](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/). I’ve enjoyed reading much of their writing, but the _breadth_ of their blog archives, dozens of posts over several years, is just as fascinating to me. And it happens with many other different things I read and watch. I find myself thinking, “Oh wow, this essay is so good. I wonder what it takes to write this well.” And when I check the archives, I find the answer: the author has been writing for twenty years.

I find _consistency_ in creative work inspiring whenever I come across it, but what strikes me even more is seeing the gradual improvement over time. I marvel when I compare the older work of makers I admire to their more recent work. And then I think, why should I? Why shouldn’t their work have gotten so much better after so long? And somewhere there, I find a lesson for myself, cliche but true: growth comes with consistency and getting good takes work.
